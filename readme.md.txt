# 🔥 Gas Detection System using Arduino and MQ Sensors

## 📌 Overview
This project detects harmful gas concentrations (e.g., LPG, CO) using MQ gas sensors and alerts users through a buzzer and LED system.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Arduino Uno
- MQ-2 or MQ-135 Gas Sensor
- Buzzer and LED
- Serial Monitor

## 🛠️ How It Works
- Analog gas sensor values are read
- If the value exceeds a threshold (e.g., 400), alarm and LED are triggered
- The sensor can detect gases like LPG, methane, smoke, CO

## 🧪 Components
- Arduino Uno
- MQ Gas Sensor (MQ-2 or MQ-135)
- Buzzer
- LED
- Breadboard, Resistors, Jumper Wires

## ▶️ Upload & Run
1. Connect circuit as per schematic
2. Upload `gas_detection.ino` to Arduino using Arduino IDE
3. Open Serial Monitor to view gas levels

## 🚨 Application Areas
- Home gas leak detection
- Industrial safety systems
- Smart IoT monitoring
